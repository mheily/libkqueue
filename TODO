 * Add a counter that increments on each each kevent() call. When printing
   debug information within kevent(), display the value of the counter.
   This will be helpful when debugging a multithreaded program that may have
   multiple kevent() calls executing in parallel.

 * Add a dbg_printf() statement within kevent_wait() to report the value
   of the timeout.

 * Refactor kevent_copyin() to remove the goto statements.

 * Ensure that kevent_copyout() on Solaris does not rely on having
   the filter lock. Linux has already been converted.

 * Fix the crasher w/ corruption in test/vnode.c

 * Add the kevent64() syscall as implemented on MacOS X. This guarantees
   that 64-bit values can be used in the 'udata' field on 32-bit platforms.

 * Include <sys/types.h> or convert u_int to uint32_t in event.h

 * Check other filters for the EV_DISPATCH bug that was fixed in r252.
